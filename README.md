# Bowling Trivia :  README  :

## Description
    This page is a bowling trivia game that I created. The page presents a title, information about the game and a start button. When the start button is clicked, it initiates the game and presents a question. Once the question is answered, the game will show correct or wrong and move onto the next question. If the question is answered wrong, the game will subtract 2 seconds from the running timer. Once all questions are answered or the time runs out, the game is over. The score is presented in the score box and the option to add scores and initials to the high scores is given. The scores will be saved in the local storage and will be there on reload of the page.
